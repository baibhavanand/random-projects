It is a number guess game. A random number between 1 to 100 will be chosen by the code and the you'll have to guess the number. If the number you chose will be less than the random number chosen by the code you'll be get "Try higher" as output. If you chose a higher number than you'll get "Try Lower" as output. Finally after guessing the correct number you'll be presented with your score which will be = the number of times you tried to guess the correct number. Have fun.
